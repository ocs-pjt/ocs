h2. Getting Started

h3. Authentication key

To request the application it is necessary to create an account on the website. Thus, the authentication key to communicate with the API is available in "Edit Account". Here is the "signup":http://cornflakes.univ-mlv.fr:8080/users/sign_up page.

h3. Use Case key

It is also necessary to create at least one Use Case key. This use case key will be used for you to provide the following information in the requests : 

* The collector used and its version (mandatory information that need to match one of the collector on the website)
* Optional information such as a program name, the program version and the attached tags

To generate this key you can either generate it from the homepage form after signing in or you can also retrieve it from a collector sending a well-crafted json request. Here is an example : 

<pre>
  <code>
   params = 
    [
      '{"email": "your_email@your_domain.com"', 
      '"authentication_key": "your_authentication_key"', 
      '"collector_name": "RUBY"',
      '"collector_version": "1.0.0"',
      '"program_name": "Word"', # Optional
      '"program_version": "1.0.0"', # Optional
      '"tags": "Biology, Genomic, Mathematic, Info"}' # Optional
    ].join(", ")
  </code>
</pre>

If some optional parameters don't exist on the server and eventually are lacking, those will be automatically created.

The header of the request needs to be set as followed : 

<pre>
  <code>
    'Accept'        = 'application/json'
    'Content-Type'  = 'application/json'
  </code>
</pre>

And the URL to request the webservice is :

<pre>
  <code>
    http://cornflakes.univ-mlv.fr:8080/use_cases/get_key
  </code>
</pre>
